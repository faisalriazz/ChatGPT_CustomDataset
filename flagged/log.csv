","'
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines them to make more accurate predictions. It works by randomly selecting a subset of features from the dataset and using them to build each decision tree. This helps to reduce the correlation between the trees, resulting in more accurate predictions. The number of features to be used for each tree is specified as a parameter to the algorithm. Additionally, the performance of the model can be estimated by using the Out-Of-Bag (OOB) samples, which are samples that were not included in the bootstrap sample. The performance of each model on its left out samples when averaged can provide an estimated accuracy of the bagged models.",,,2023-04-10 22:19:10.408334
